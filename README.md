# Ally's Closet

This website was made to display and sell new and slighly-used articles of clothing. Users can view items either by searching or scrolling through the list. Payments are handled by PayPal, but credit cards are accepted as well. Check it out [here](http://www.allyscloset.org)!

## Tools
This website was built with HTML, Bootstrap, React/Redux, Node and Express. PostgreSQL was used as the RDBMS. PayPal was used in order to ensure a secure and smooth payment flow.

## API

I built my own API using Node and Express. It is a complete REST API with full CRUD functionality.

## The Target User

This app was made for Ally and her 9,000+ followers on Facebook that relied on Facebook Groups for advertising and purchases.

## Database Schema

The database schema is very simple. It just consists of an items table, and each item has fields such as product_name, price, quantity, color, description, etc.
